## Manim for Astronomy [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/simonehagey/astronomy_manim.git/main)

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks for learning how to use Manim for astronomy presentations. Manim is an 
animation engine that is wrapped up in a Python library, designed for creating explanatory math videos by 
Grant Sanderson of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown). Since 2020, it has been enhanced and
maintained by a dedicated community.
